    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "    A Class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that an object of that class will have. A class is like a prototype that you can use to create many objects of the same kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An Object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own attributes and behaviors. An object is a real-world object, like a person, a car, a bank account, etc., that you want to represent in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, consider a class called \"Car\". The class could define the attributes of a car such as make, model, year, color, etc., and behaviors such as starting the engine, accelerating, braking, etc. You can then create multiple objects of the \"Car\" class, each representing a specific car, such as a red 2019 Honda Civic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So, the class is a blueprint, while an object is an instance created from that blueprint."
