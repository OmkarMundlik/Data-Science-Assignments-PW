    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset, obtained by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and can be affected by outliers, so it is best used when the data is normally distributed or symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset, with half of the observations above it and half below it. The median is more robust than the mean and is less affected by outliers or skewed data. It is a good measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or has extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in the data, and can be used with any type of data, including nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. The range is useful for identifying the spread of the data and for detecting outliers. However, the range is affected by extreme values and may not accurately reflect the variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures how spread out the data is from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and dividing by the number of observations minus one. The variance is useful for quantifying the variability of the data and for comparing the variability between groups or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is a more commonly used measure of variability. It measures the spread of the data in relation to the mean, and is used to describe the typical distance of the observations from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data is tightly clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out."
